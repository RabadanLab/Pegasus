</div>
<p>HyperSQL has many modes of operation and features that allow it to
    be used in very different scenarios. Levels of memory usage, speed and
    accessibility by different applications are influenced by how HyperSQL is
    deployed.</p>

<p>The decision to run HyperSQL as a separate server process or as an
      <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> database should be based on the
      following:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>When HyperSQL is run as a server on a separate machine, it
            is isolated from hardware failures and crashes on the hosts

</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>When HyperSQL is run as a server on the same machine, it is
            isolated from application crashes and memory leaks.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Server connections are slower than
            <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> connections due to the overhead

</li>
<li class="listitem">

<a name="mtc_table_types"></a>Tables</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>TEXT tables are designed for special applications where the data
      has to be in an interchangeable format, such as CSV (comma separated
      values). TEXT tables should not be used for routine storage of
      data.</p>
<p>MEMORY tables and CACHED tables are generally used for data
      storage. The difference between the two is as follows:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>The data for all MEMORY tables is read from the *.script
            file when the database is started and stored in memory. In
            contrast the data for cached tables is not read into memory until
            the table is accessed. Furthermore, only part of the data for each
            CACHED table is held in memory, allowing tables with more data
            than can be held in memory.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>When the database is shutdown in the normal way, all the
            data for MEMORY tables is written out to the disk. In comparison,
            the data in CACHED tables that has changed is written out during
            operation and at shutdown.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>The size and capacity of the data cache for all the CACHED
            tables is configurable. This makes it possible to allow all the
            data in CACHED tables to be cached in memory. In this case, speed
            of access is good, but slightly slower than MEMORY tables.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>For normal applications it is recommended that MEMORY tables
            are used for small amounts of data, leaving CACHED tables for
            large data sets. For special applications in which speed is
            paramount and a large amount of free memory is available, MEMORY
            tables can be used for large tables as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Large Objects">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_large_objects"></a>Large Objects</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>HyperSQL 2.0 supports dedicated storage and access to BLOB and
      CLOB objects. These objects can have huge sizes. BLOB or CLOB is
      specified as the type of a column of the table. Afterwards, rows can be
      inserted into the table using a PreparedStatement for efficient transfer
      of large LOB data to the database. In <em class="glossterm">mem:</em>
      catalogs, CLOB and BLOB data is stored in memory. In
      <em class="glossterm">file:</em> catalogs, this data is stored in a single
      separate file which has the extension *.lobs. The size of this file can
      grow to huge, terabyte figures.</p>
<p>LOB data should be store in the database using a JDBC
      PreparedStatement object. The streaming methods send the LOB to the
      database in one operation as a binary or character stream. Inside the
      database, the disk space is allocated as needed and the data is saved as
      it is being received. LOB data should be retrieved from the database
      using a JDBC ResultSet method. When a streaming method is used to
      retrieve a LOB, it is retrieved in large chunks in a transparent manner.
      LOB data can also be stored by calling a JDBC method with String or
      byte[] argument, but these methods limit the size of the LOB that can be
      stored or retrieved.</p>
<p>LOB data is not duplicated in the database when a lob is copied
      from one table to another. The disk space is reused when a LOB is
      deleted and is no longer contained in any table. This happens only at
      the time of a CHECKPOINT.</p>
<p>By using a dedicated LOB store, HyperSQL achieves consistently
      high speeds (usually over 20MB / s) for both storage and retrieval of
      LOBs.</p>
<p>There is an internal LOBS schema in the database to store the
      id's, sizes and addresses of the LOBs (but not the actual LOBS) in a few
      system tables. This schema is stored in the database as MEMORY tables.
      Therefore the amount of JVM memory should be increased when more than
      tens of thousands of LOBs are stored in the database. If your database
      contains more than a few hundreds of thousands of LOBs and memory use
      becomes an issue, you can change one or all LOB schema tables to CACHED
      tables. See statements below:</p>
<div class="example">

</div>
</div>
<p>The files used for storing HyperSQL database data are all in the
      same directory. New files are always created and deleted by the database
      engine. Two simple principles must be observed:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>The Java process running HyperSQL must have full privileges on
          the directory where the files are stored. This include create and
          delete privileges.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>The file system must have enough spare room both for the
          'permanent' and 'temporary' files. The default maximum size of the
          *.log file is 50MB. The *.data file can grow to up to 16GB (more if
          the default has been increased). The .backup file can be up to the
          size of the *.data file. The *.lobs file can grow to several
          terabytes. The temporary files created at the time of a SHUTDOWN can
          be equal in size to the *.script file and the .data file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Readonly Databases">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_readonly_database"></a>Readonly Databases</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <em class="glossterm">file:</em> catalog can be made readonly
      permanently, or it can be opened as readonly. To make the database
      readonly, the property, value pair, readonly=true can be added to the
      .properties file of the database.</p>
<p>It is also possible to open a normal database as readonly. For
      this, the property can be included in the URL of the first connection to
      the database.</p>
<p>There is another option which allows MEMORY tables to be writable,
      but without persisting the changes at SHUTDOWN. This option is activated
      with the property, value pair, <code class="literal">files_readonly= true</code>,
      which can be added to the .properties file of the database, or included
      in the URL of the first connection to the database. This option is
      useful for running application tests which operate on a predefined
      dataset.</p>

<p>HyperSQL 2.0 uses the same persistence mechanism as version 1.8, but
    with important enhancements. The code has proven reliable, as the last
    critical issue was fixed 2 years before the release of version 2.0.</p>
<p>There are further enhancements in version 2.2</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Persistence relies on the JVM, the operating system, and the
    computer hardware. A database system like HSQLDB can perform millions of
    read and write operations in an hour. As system hardware and software can
    go wrong, it is impossible to achieve zero failure rate. Therefore regular
    backups are recommended. HyperSQL 2.2 has built-in database backup and
    restore features, discussed elsewhere in this chapter.</p>
<p>A note regarding the nio implementation: This implementation applies
    only to CACHED table data in the .data file. Other files are not accessed
    via nio. There has been an issue with some JVM implementations of nio not
    releasing the file buffers after they were closed. HyperSQL uses a
    workaround which is recommended with Sun JVM's. This does not apply to
    other JVM's. In such environments, it is therefore recommended to test the
    CHECKPOINT DEFRAG operation and the shutting down and restarting the
    database inside the same Java process extensively with nio. Use of nio can
    be turned off if necessary.</p>
<div class="section" title="Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_acid"></a>Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Atomicity means a transaction either fails without changing the
      data, or succeeds. HyperSQL ensures atomicity both during operations and
      in the event of a system crash.</p>
<p>Consistency means all the implicit and explicit integrity
      constraints are always enforced. HyperSQL always enforces the
      constraints and at the same time does not allow unenforceable
      constraints (illegal forms of CHECK constraints) to be created.</p>
<p>Isolation means transactions do not interfere with each other.
      HyperSQL enforces isolation according to strict rules of the database
      isolation model (MVCC or LOCKS).</p>
<p>Durability means a committed transaction is protected in case of a
      system crash. HyperSQL ensures durability according to the setting for
      WRITE DELAY MILLIS. A zero delay setting results in an
      FileDescriptor#sync() call each time a transaction commits. A timed
      delay means the FileDescriptor#sync() call is executed in the given
      intervals and only the last transactions committed in the interval may
      be lost. The sync() call is also made at all critical points, including
      when a file is about to be closed. Durability of files requires a
      reliable JVM and disk storage system that stores the data safely with a
      sync() call. In practice, many systems are generally reliable in this
      respect.</p>

<a name="mtc_backup"></a>Backing Up Database Catalogs</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<a name="N140A0" class="indexterm"></a>
<p>The database engine saves the files containing all the data in a
    file catalog when a shutdown takes place. It automatically recovers from
    an abnormal termination and preserves the data when the catalog is opened
    next time. In an ideal operating environment, where there is no OS crash,
    disk failure, bugs in code, etc. there would be no need regularly to
    backup a database. This is meant to say, the engine performs the routine
    shutdown procedure internally, therefore backing up catalogs is an
    insurance policy against all sorts of misadventure that are not under the
    control of the database engine.</p>
<p>The data for each catalog consists of up to 5 files in the same
    directory with the endings such as <code class="literal">*.properties</code>,
    <code class="literal">*.script</code>, etc., as detailed in previous
    chapters.</p>
<p>HyperSQL 2.0 includes commands to backup the database files into
    a single <code class="literal">.tar</code> or <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> file
    archive. The backup can be performed by a command given in a JDBC session
    if the target database catalog is running, or on the command-line if the
    target catalog has been shutdown.</p>

<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_online_backup"></a>Making Online Backups</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To back up a running catalog, obtain a JDBC connection and
      issue a <code class="literal">BACKUP DATABASE</code> command in SQL. In its most
      simple form, the command format below will backup the database as a
      single <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> file to the given directory.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">  BACKUP DATABASE TO &lt;directory name&gt; BLOCKING</pre>
<p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>directory name</em></span> must end with a slash
      to distinguish it as a directory, and the whole string must be in single
      quotes like so: <code class="literal">'subdir/nesteddir/'</code>.</p>
<p>See the next section under Statements for details about the
      command and its options. See the sections below about restoring a

<p>To back up an offline catalog, the catalog must be in shut down
      state. You will run a Java command like this. In this example, the
      database is named dbname and is in the dbdir directory. The backup is
      saved to a file named backup.tar in the tardir directory.</p>

<p>HyperSQL supports encrypted databases. Encryption services use the
    Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) and uses the ciphers installed with the
    JRE. HyperSQL itself does not contain any cryptography code.</p>
<p>Three elements are involved in specifying the encryption method and
    key. A cipher, together with its configuration is identified by a string
    which includes the name of the cipher and optional parameters. A provider
    is the fully qualified class name of the cipher provider. A key is
    represented as a hexadecimal string.</p>
<div class="section" title="Creating and Accessing an Encrypted Database">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_encrypted_create"></a>Creating and Accessing an Encrypted Database</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>First, a key must be created for the desired cipher and
      configuration. This is done by calling the function CRYPT_KEY(&lt;cipher
      spec&gt;, &lt;provider&gt;). If the default provider (the built-in JVM
      ciphers) is used, then NULL should be specified as the provider. The
      CRYPT_KEY function returns a hexadecimal key. The function call can be
      made in any HyperSQL database, so long as the provider class is on the
      classpath. This key can be used to create a new encrypted database.
      Calls to this function always return different keys, based on a
      generated random values.</p>
<p>As an example, a call to CRYPT_KEY('Blowfish', null) returned the
      string, '604a6105889da65326bf35790a923932'. To create a new database,
      the URL below is used:</p>
<p>
<code class="literal">jdbc:hsqldb:file:&lt;database
      path&gt;;crypt_key=604a6105889da65326bf35790a923932;crypt_type=blowfish</code>
</p>
<p>The third property name is crypt_provider. This is specified only
      when the provider is not the default provider.</p>
<p>HyperSQL works with any symmetric cipher that may be available
      from the JVM.</p>
<p>The files that are encrypted include the .script, .data, .backup
      and .log files. The .lobs file is not encrypted by default. The property
      crypt_lobs=true must be specified to encrypt the .lobs file.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>General operations on an encrypted database are performed the same
      as with any database. However, some operations are significantly slower
      than with the equivalent cleartext database. With MEMORY tables, there
      is no difference to the speed of SELECT statements, but data change
      statements are slower. With CACHED tables, the speed of all statements
      is slower.</p>

<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_encrypted_security"></a>Security Considerations</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Security considerations for encrypted databases have been
      discussed at length in HSQLDB discussion groups. Development team
      members have commented that encryption is not a panacea for all security
      needs. The following issues should be taken into account:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Encrypted files are relatively safe in transport, but
            because databases contain many repeated values and words,
            especially known tokens such as CREATE, INSERT, etc., breaking the
            encryption of a database may be simpler than an unknown
            file.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Only the files are encrypted, not the memory image. Poking
            into computer memory, while the database is open, will expose the
            contents of the database.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>HyperSQL is open source. Someone who has the key, can
            compile and use a modified version of the program that saves a
            full cleartext dump of an encrypted database</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Therefore encryption is generally effective only when
      the users who have access to the crypt key are trusted.</p>

<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_external_monitoring"></a>External Statement Level Monitoring</h3>

<p>Statement level monitoring allows you to gather statistics about
      executed statements. HyperSQL is supported by the monitoring tool JAMon
      (Java Application Monitor). JAMon is currently developed as the
      SourceForge project, jamonapi.</p>
<p>JAMon works at the JDBC level. It can monitor and gather
      statistics on different types of executed statements or other JDBC
      calls.</p>
<p>Early versions of JAMon were developed with HSQLDB and had to be
      integrated into HSQLDB at code level. The latest versions can be added
      on as a proxy in a much simpler fashion.</p>

<p>The internally-generated, individual sql log for the database can
      be enabled with the <code class="literal">SET DATABASE EVENT LOG SQL LEVEL</code>
      statement, described in the next section. As all the executed
      statements are logged, there is an impact on speed. So you should only
      use this for debugging. Two levels of sql logging are supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Internal Event Monitoring">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_internal_event_monitoring"></a>Internal Event Monitoring</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>HyperSQL can log important internal events of the engine. These
      events occur during the operation of the engine, and are not always
      coupled with the exact type of statement being executed. Normal events
      such as opening and closing of files, or errors such as OutOfMemory
      conditions are examples of logged events.</p>
<p>HyperSQL supports two methods of logging. One method is specific
      to the individual database and is managed internally by HyperSQL. The
      other method is specific to JVM and is managed by a logging
      framework.</p>
<p>The internally-generated, individual log for the database can be
      enabled with the <code class="literal">SET DATABASE EVENT LOG LEVEL</code>
      statement, described in the next section. This method of logging is very
      useful for desktop application deployment, as it provides an ongoing
      record of database operations.</p>
<p>HyperSQL also supports log4J and JDK logging. The same event
      information that is passed to the internal log, is passed to external
      logging frameworks. These frameworks are configured outside HyperSQL.
      The log messages include the string "hsqldb.db." followed by the unique
      id (a 16 character string) of the database that generated the message,
      so they can be identified in a multi-database server context.</p>

<p>HyperSQL security is multi-layered and avoids any loopholes to

<div class="section" title="Security Defaults">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_security_defaults"></a>Security Defaults</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The default setting are generally adequate for most embedded use
      of the database or for servers on the host that are accessed from the
      same machine. For servers accessed within a network, and especially for
      those accessed from outside the network, additional security settings
      must be used.</p>
<p>The default settings for server and web server do not use SSL or
      IP access control lists. These features are enabled programatically, or
      with the properties used to start the server.</p>
<p>The default settings allow a database user with the DBA role or
      with schema creation role to access static functions on the classpath.
      You can disable this feature or limit it to specific classes and
      methods. This can be done programatically or by setting a system
      property when you start a server.</p>
<p>If access to specific static functions is granted, then these
      functions must be considered as part of the database program and checked
      for any security flaws before inclusion in the classpath.</p>
<p>The default settings do not allow a user to access files outside
      the database directory. This access is for TEXT table source files. You
      can override this programatically or with a system property when you
      start a server.</p>
<p>The encryption of database file does not utilise any user-supplied
      information for encryption keys. This level of security is outside the
      realm of users and passwords.</p>
<p>The first user for a new database has the DBA role. This user name
      need not be SA. The name of the first DBA user and its password can be
      specified when the database is created by the first connection to the
      database. These settings are then stored in the database.</p>
<p>The initial user with the DBA role should be used for admin
      purposes only. At least one additional role should be created for normal
      database use in the application and at least one additional user should
      be created and granted this role. The new role should not be given the
      DBA role. It can be given the CREATE_SCHEMA role, which allows it to
      create and access multiple schemas. Alternatively, the user with the DBA
      role can create the schemas and their objects and then grant specific
      privileges on the objects to the non-DBA role.</p>

<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_authentication_control"></a>Authentication Control</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Authentication is the mechanism that determines if a user can
      access the database at all. Once authentication is performed, the
      authorization mechanism is used to determine which database objects the
      particular user can access. The default authentication mechanism is
      password authentication. Each user is created with a password, which is
      stored in the database and checked each time a new database connection
      is created.</p>
<a name="N141C5" class="indexterm"></a>
<p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Password Complexity
      Check</strong></span>
</p>
<p>HyperSQL allows you to define a function that checks the quality
      of the passwords defined in the database. The passwords are stored in
      the database. Each time a user connects, the user's name and password
      are checked against the stored list of users and passwords. The
      connection attempt is rejected if there is no match.</p>
<a name="N141D0" class="indexterm"></a>
<p>
<span class="bold"><strong>External
      Authentication</strong></span>
</p>
<p>You can use an external authentication mechanism instead of the
      internal authentication mechanism. HyperSQL allows you to define a
      function that checks the combination of database unique name, user name,
      and password for each connection attempt. The function can use external
      resources to authenticate the user. For example, a directory server may
      be used. The password may be ignored if the external resource can verify
      the user's credential without it.</p>
<p>You can override external authentication for a user with the ALTER
      USER statement. See the <a class="link" href="accesscontrol-chapt.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Access Control">Access Control</a> chapter</p>

<p>HyperSQL is used more than any other database engine for application
    testing and development targeted at other databases. Over the years, this
    usage resulted in developers finding and reporting many obscure bugs in
    HyperSQL, which have all been fixed in the latest version. Also, HyperSQL
    2.0 has been written to the SQL Standard and avoids the traps caused by
    superficial imitation of existing RDBMS.</p>
<p>HyperSQL has many property settings that relax conformance to the
    Standard in order to allow compatibility with other RDBMS, without
    breaking the core integrity of the database. These properties are modified
    with SET DATABASE SQL statements described in the SQL Conformance Settings
    section of this chapter</p>
<p>The SQL Standard has existed since 1989 and has been expanded over
    the years in several revisions. Also, the X-Open specification has defined
    a number of SQL functions which are implemented by most RDBMS.</p>
<p>Each RDBMS supports additional functions that are not covered by the
    standard. Some RDBMS use non-standard syntax for some operations.
    Fortunately, most popular RDBMS products have introduced better
    compatibility with the Standard in their recent versions, but there are
    still some portability issues. HyperSQL overcomes the potability issues
    using these strategies</p>

<p>These statements modify the level of conformance to the SQL

      for compatibility with other database engines and are FALSE by default.
      For all the rest of the settings, TRUE means better conformance to the
      Standard (unless the Standard defines the behaviour as implementation
      dependent). The default value of a few of these settings is FALSE, due
      to widespread non-conforming statements that are already in use in user
      applications or statements generated by object relational tools. So long
      as it is practical, it is best to set the non-conforming defaults to

</p>
<p>Older versions of HSQLDB perform a backup of the .data file
      before its contents are modified and the whole .data file is saved in a
      compressed form when a CHECKPOINT or SHUTDOWN is performed. This takes a
      long time when the size of the database exceeds 100 MB or so (on an
      average 2010 computer, you can expect a backup speed of 20MB per second
      or more).</p>
<p>The alternative is backup in increments, just before some part
      of the .data file is modified. In this mode, no backup is performed at
      CHECKPOINT or SHUTDOWN. This mode is preferred for large databases which
      are opened and closed frequently.</p>
<p>The default mode is <code class="literal">TRUE</code>. If the old method
      of backup is preferred, the mode can be set
      <code class="literal">FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>Warning: The old, non-incremental setting, FALSE, shouldn't be
      used at all when the data file is larger than 4GB. If it is used, the

<p>The purpose of this command is to control the amount of data loss
